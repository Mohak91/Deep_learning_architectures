# Deep_learning_architectures
I will be populating this repository with different neural network architectures (feed-forward NNs, convolutional NNs, Recurrent NNs, transformers etc.) from scratch in python. I will also implement improving these networks using hyperparameter tuning, regularization and optimization. Structuring deep learning workflows for large-scale problems.
